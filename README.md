# my_Zettlr_templates
When I started studying Social Science I wrote all my texts with LATEX. I started using Zettlr in March 2023. Because I still wanted my texts to look the same as before, so I created the templates oyu can find in this repository. I will upload all new templates I create in here. Feel free to get inspired to create your own. 

| template      | usecase                                                                  |
