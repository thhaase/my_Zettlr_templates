# my_Zettlr_templates
When I started studying Social Science I used to write all my texts with LATEX in Atom. 
I started using Zettlr in March 2023, but I still wanted my texts to look the same as before, so I created the templates in this repository. 
I'm going to upload all new templates I create in here. 
Feel free to get inspired to create your own.
